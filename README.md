# FSND_P06

Currently when run in `webpack-dev-server` shows an error `Uncaught ReferenceError: ko is not defined`

Hope someone can send me in the right direction to get this working...

The project can be run using the following commands. (requires yarn and git installed)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kaisaurus/FSND_P06.git
cd FSND_P06
yarn install
webpack-dev-server
```
