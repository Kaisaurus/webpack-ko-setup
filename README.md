# FSND_P06

This is a basic Webpack 2 setup for the Maps project from the Udacity nanodegree.

It uses:
- Babel (so javascript can be written in ES6/ES2015)
- Sass
- KnockoutJS

To install you need:
- a package manager like npm or Yarn (I will use Yarn in the following instructions)


## Quick setup

Doing the quicksetup doesn't help you understand the steps to set it up by yourself in the future.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kaisaurus/FSND_P06.git
cd FSND_P06
yarn install
webpack-dev-server
```
